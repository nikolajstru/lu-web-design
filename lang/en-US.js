Unfortunately, it is forbidden to ride a bike on it, but it was allowed to go earlier and it was possible to run a bike quickly from the bridge and reach up to 40 km / h, because the slope of the bridge is fast enough.',

Until 1944, it was the Holy Trinity Church - one of the first Lutheran stone churches built in Europe and the first stone building in Jelgava. The church was the largest in Semigallia and belonged to the German congregation.',

The most important reason is free time, which can be used both usefully and not. The right time to sleep 30 min. Unfortunately, trains in Latvia are in a very bad condition and it is not even possible to compare them with European trains. Traveling by train in Latvia is the worst scenery, because the trains are very loud. I look forward to the new train, which promises to be delivered in 2024. Of course, there is a possibility that this will happen much later due to the pandemic.',

        body: 'Another way to get to Riga is to ride a motorcycle. There are several pros and cons to this option. The pros would be the speed and size of the motorcycle that helps to avoid congestion, while the cons alone is weather dependent and there is not much enjoyment from riding in the rain. If there is rain another alternative is a machine. I have to admit that I haven\'t ridden a bike to work yet, but I am in my free time.',

In order to successfully combine work with study, it is necessary to follow a completely different work rhythm than other colleagues. The office is a place where no desire will not work.

        body: 'Parking spaces are available in the office yard. Parking is not free. Free parking is only available to department heads. You have to pay around 30 eur per month. So the big plus is the motorcycle, because the motorcycle has free parking right next to the office. There is still a possibility to park about 500 meters from the roadside work. Admittedly, it is often busy, so you have to drive early in the morning to get a place to shop without a wallet.',

It is very hopeful that the training will continue remotely, as this can save a lot not only time but also money. Studying remotely saves about 2 hours a day because you don\'t have to go to transport and don\'t have to spend time in traffic jams.',

        title: 'Public transport',
        body: 'There are many stops around the university, allowing you to choose transport to get home or to work. There are stops for buses, trolleybuses and trams. Of course, it is always possible to use a taxi, but it would be much cheaper to use public transport, because students have an e-ticket and public transport costs only 0.15 eur. In any case, I often do not use public transport in Riga traffic, because I only have to walk to the railway station for 10 minutes. On the other hand, when my leg was broken I was forced to use public transport to save energy.',

There have been cases when the train stops and does not continue because of a railway accident. There have also been cases when there are atypically large congestions in Riga, which do not allow us to go to work or university.',

But work is most often loyal and allows you to go to study when you need it. A very big plus is that it is possible to work remotely, because it is much easier to combine work with training.',

I don\'t like just chatting on the phone, but riding a bike and talking is a completely different thing, because it can also improve the social situation.',
